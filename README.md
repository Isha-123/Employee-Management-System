# Employee Management System


Developed a Student Management System using Python and MySQL, enabling efficient add, delete, update, and export of student data with real-time
synchronization to the MySQL server.
Utilized SQL queries like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and ALTER to ensure robust data manipulation and consistency.
The Employee Management System uses the Sqlite3 module, which provides built-in security features such as secure database connections, 
and protection against SQL injection to safeguard against attacks and protect sensitive data.
